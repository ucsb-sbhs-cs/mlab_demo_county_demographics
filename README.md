# mlab_demo_county_demographics

A second mlab demo, with no web app involved.   

We are using data from the CORGIS project, specifically the [county demographics file](https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/json/county_demographics/county_demographics.html) which in turn, gets its data from the [US Census](http://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/00)

The original file can be downloaded from [here](https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/json/county_demographics/demographics.json?forcedownload=1)

A snapshot of that file is in this repo in [demographics.json](demographics.json)
